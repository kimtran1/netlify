zForm has a variety of forms related to tax that one can fill out quickly through the questionnaire interface. This process has helped me fill out the forms easily without having to decipher the tricky technical language.

  

**Business Related Forms**

This website is also helpful to use when managing a business. It streamlines the hiring process by providing the user with templates like the employee offer letter, the i9 form, and the W4 form. Also, the invoice templates, pay stub templates, and time-off request forms can be useful when managing one's business finances and operations. There are also forms to aid in starting a business as a single-member LLC operating agreement.

  

**Legal Paperwork and Liability Waivers**

In addition to business-related forms, zform also offers liability waivers consisting of social media release forms and background check release forms.

  

**Real Estate Related Forms**

While I have not used their real-estate-related forms, there is a variety of forms that can serve to aid in the process of renting or subleasing a new place. zForm has forms including the proof of residency letter, a letter of intent for real estate, small estate affidavits, and a pet addendum form.

  

**Customizable forms**

While IRS forms are the primary forms on their website, the user can create their own unique forms for use. This can be done by creating an account and uploaded a blank version of the form. The user can drag and drop boxes to indicate an area to fill out. After the form builds, it will be easily shared through a unique URL to access that form.
